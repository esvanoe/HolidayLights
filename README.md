# HolidayLights

# A place to store code for controlling Holiday lights, primarily WS2811 Strips

- Code primarily written for the Particle Photon platform. If it doesn't say otherwise it is for Photon.
- Must add neopixel.h module to each program inside the Particle Wed IDE.
- For some reason have really run into issues with the WS2811 / WS2812B not working properly at times, may be a function of resistor value but not sure
